# Note_taker

## Description:
For this application I set up a note taking page where you can enter a title of a note and then details about that note. Every note will be saved for a user to access another time and there is also an option for a person to delete a note. The functionality of the application was set up through server.js with app.get, app.post, and app.delete.
